## Services Starting...

I've started all three services in the background:

1. ✅ **Fingerprinting Service** - Port 5000
2. ✅ **Backend API** - Port 3000  
3. ✅ **Frontend** - Port 5173

## Access Your Demo

🌐 **Frontend (Main App)**: http://localhost:5173

🔍 **Test Services**:
- Backend Health: http://localhost:3000/health
- Fingerprinting Health: http://localhost:5000/health

## What to Do Next

1. **Open your browser** and go to: http://localhost:5173
2. **Explore the UI**:
   - Browse the marketplace
   - Check out the upload page
   - View model details

## Note

The services are running in **demo mode**:
- ✅ UI is fully functional
- ✅ Frontend-backend communication works
- ⚠️ Blockchain features require contract deployment
- ⚠️ Database features require PostgreSQL setup

## To Stop Services

Press `Ctrl+C` in each terminal window, or close the terminal windows.
